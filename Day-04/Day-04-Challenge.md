# Day-04 Loops

### Tasks:

**Activity 1: for Loop**

- Task-01: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- Task-02: Write a program to print the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.

**Activity 2: while Loop**

- Task-03: Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
- Task-04: Write a program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using a while loop.

**Activity 3: do...while Loop**

- Task-05: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using a do...while loop.
- Task-06: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

**Activity 4: Nested Loop**

- Task-07: Write a program to print a pattern using nested for loops

**Activity 5: Loop Control Statements**

- Task-08: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip the number 5 using the continue statement.
- Task-09: Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but stop the loop when the number is 7 using the break statement.

**Feature Request:**

1. Number Printing Script: Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop and a while loop.
2. Multiplication Table Script: Create a script that prints the multiplication table of 5 using a for loop.
3. Pattern Printing Script: Write a script that prints a pattern of stars using nested loops.
4. Sum Calculation Script: Write a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
5. Factorial Calculation Script: Create a script that calculates the factorial of a number using a do….. while loop.

**Achievement:**

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Unlize whe loops for teration based on a caston. e of numbers.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
