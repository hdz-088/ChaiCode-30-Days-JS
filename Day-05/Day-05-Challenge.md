# Day-04 Loops

### Tasks:

**Activity 1: Function Declaration**

- Task-01: Write a function to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.
- Task-02: Write a function to calculate the square of a number and return the result.

**Activity 2: Function Expression**

- Task-03: Write a function expression to find the maximum of two numbers and log the result to the console.
- Task-04: Write a function expression to concatenate two strings and return the result.

**Activity 3: Arrow Function**

- Task-05: Write an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbers and return the result.
- Task-06: Write an arrow function to check if a string contains a specific character and return a boolean value.

**Activity 4: Function Parameters & Default Values**

- Task-07: Write a function that takes two parameters and return their product. Provide a default value for the second operator.
- Task-08: Write a function that takes person's name and age and return a greeting message. Provide a default value for the age.

**Activity 5: Higher Order Functions**

- Task-09: Write a higher order function that takes a function and a number and calls the function that many times
- Task-10: Write a higher order function that takes two functions and a value, applies the first function to the value, and then applies second function to the result.

**Feature Request:**

1. Even or Odd Function Script: Write a script that includes a function to check if a number is even or odd and logs the result.
2. Square Calculation Function Script: Create a script that includes a function to calculate the square of a number and returns the result.
3. Concatenation Function Script: Write a script that includes a function expression to concatenate two strings and returns the result.
4. Sum Calculation Arrow Function Script: Create a script that includes an arrow function to calculate the sum of two numbers and returns the result.
5. Higher-Order Function Script: Write a script that includes a higher-order function to apply a given function multiple times.

**Achievement:**

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize higher-order functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
- Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.
