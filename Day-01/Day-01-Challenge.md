## Day-01 Challenge

### Tasks:

**Activity-01: Variable Decleration**
- Task-01: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
- Task-02: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console. 

**Activity-02: Constant Declaration**
- Task-03: Declare a variable using const, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

**Activity-03: Data Types**
- Task-04: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator.

**Activity-04: Reassigning Variables**
- Task-05: Declare a variable using let, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

**Activity-05: Understanding const**
-Task-06: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error.

### Feature Request:
1. Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
2. Reassignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignment.

### Achievement:
By the end of these activities, you will:

- Know how to declare variables using var, let, and const .
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the typeof operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of const variables.
