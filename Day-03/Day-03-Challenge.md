# Day-03 Control Structures

### Tasks:

**Activity 1: if-else Statements**

- Task-01: Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the console.
- Task-02: Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) and log the result to the console.

**Activity 2: Nested if-else Statements**

- Task-03: Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements.

**Activity 3: Switch Case**

- Task-04: Wite a program that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on number and log the name of the day in console
- Task-05: Write a program that uses switch case to assign a grade based on score and log the grade to the console.

**Activity 4: Ternary Operator**

- Task-06: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to console

**Activity 5: Combining Conditions**

- Task-07: Write a program to check if a year is leap year using multiple condition and log the result to console.
